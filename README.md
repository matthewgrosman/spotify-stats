# Spotifstats

[spotifstats.com](https://www.spotifstats.com)

A website that shows your top artists and songs from your Spotify listening history! View your favorites across several different time ranges to see how your listening patterns have changed (or maybe how they have not so much changed).

This site was made using Java as the back-end language, HTML + CSS + JavaScript for the front-end, Maven to manage dependencies for the web-app side of things, and then deployment was done on Heroku. The Spotify functionality comes from using the [Java Spotify API wrapper](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-java) in the back-end.
